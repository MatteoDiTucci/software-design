# Why read this book
Software design is a craft not a science. To master it you cannot just study a book that explains comprehensively all the theory behind it.    
You have to read the literature of many great developers, looking for advices that repeat: that's what you then consider good software design.  
However, the literature is vast, and it takes much time to get the big picture out of single sources.  
This book makes three promises:
  * to be a catalogue of everything that constitutes good software design
  * to be very succinct
  * to mention trustworthy sources to go deeper 

# Who should read this book
The book is intended mainly for people who just started their journey into software design or who are in the middle of it.  
If you have being seriously studying the topic for 5+ years, likely you are not going to find big surprises. However, I still  
suggest you to go through the table of contents: you might find one or two learnings worth a quick read.

# Who I am
My name is Matteo Di Tucci, I currently work at ThoughtWorks.  
I am a developer by accident. I picked up coding in university because I did not know what to do when growing up.   
I still do not know, but along the way I pleasantly discovered I like software and its design.

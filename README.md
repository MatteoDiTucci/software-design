### Where to read the book

### Feedback
Feel free to open a pull request if you want to provide any feedback. Thank you for that.

### Current status
Half of the chapters have been written, but I have been focusing on other projects.
Ideally, one day I would like to finish the remaining chapters and write a sibling book from the perspective of functional programming.

### Tech stack
* Layout: [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
* Hosting: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Contributing
To add a new chapter, just create a new bullet point in [SUMMARY.MD](src/SUMMARY.md) and the corresponding markdown file.
More info about mdBook can be found in the [official guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html)

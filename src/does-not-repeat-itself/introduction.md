Complexity is made of two elements: cognitive load and coupling. Cognitive load means how hard is to understand code. 
Coupling means how many parts of a codebase we need to adjust when we want to change only one thing.

Isolating concepts in single parts of the code base greatly reduces both cognitive load and coupling.
